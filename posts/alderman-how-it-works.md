## Loot

Loot refers to the virtual items, treasures, or rewards that players can obtain, create, manage, and share within the game. These can range from weapons and armor to magical artifacts and gold, enhancing the depth and excitement of gameplay.

*D&D 5e Example*

> **Bag of Holding**
>
> *Wondrous item, uncommon*
>
> This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

## Loot Tables

A Loot Table is a predefined list or set of Loot from which the game system randomly selects when determining what loot players receive. This allows for variability and surprise in the items players might obtain during their adventures.

*D&D 5e Example*

> Magic Item Table A
> 
> | d100 | Magic Item |
> |------|------------|
> | 01-50 | Potion of Healing |
> | 51-60 | Spell scroll (cantrip) |
> | 61-70 | Potion of climbing |
> | 71-90 | Spell scroll (1st level) |
> | 91-94 | Spell scroll (2nd level) |
> | 95-98 | Potion of greater healing |
> | 99 | Bag of holding |
> | 00 | Driftglobe |
