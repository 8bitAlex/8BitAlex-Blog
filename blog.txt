## Concepts

### Loot

Loot refers to the virtual items, treasures, or rewards that players can obtain, create, manage, and share within the game. These can range from weapons and armor to magical artifacts and gold, enhancing the depth and excitement of gameplay.

*D&D 5e Example*

> **Staff of Healing**
>
> *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or
druid)*
>
> This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use
an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one
of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC
and spellcasting ability modifier: cure wounds (1 charge
per spell level, up to 4th), lesser restoration (2 charges).
or mass cure wounds (5 charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1.
the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.

### Loot Tables

A Loot Table is a predefined list or set of Loot from which the game system randomly selects when determining what loot players receive. This allows for variability and surprise in the items players might obtain during their adventures.

*D&D 5e Example*

> Magic Item Table A
> 
> | d100 | Magic Item |
> |------|------------|
> | 01-50 | Potion of Healing |
> | 51-60 | Spell scroll (cantrip) |
> | 61-70 | Potion of climbing |
> | 71-90 | Spell scroll (1st level) |
> | 91-94 | Spell scroll (2nd level) |
> | 95-98 | Potion of greater healing |
> | 99 | Bag of holding |
> | 00 | Driftglobe |
